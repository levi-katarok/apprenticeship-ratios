        This site provides free access to state-by-state apprenticeship ratio requirements
        for public works construction projects.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-serif text-xl text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">What are apprenticeship ratios?</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Many states require contractors on public works projects to employ apprentices
        at specific ratios relative to journeyman workers. These requirements help develop
        a skilled construction workforce while ensuring quality on publicly funded projects.
        Requirements vary significantly by state — from specific apprentice-to-journeyman
        ratios (e.g., 1 apprentice per 5 journeyman in California) to percentage-based
        utilization targets (e.g., 15% apprentice hours in Washington).
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-serif text-xl text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">Federal IRA requirement</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 established a nationwide apprenticeship requirement
        for projects seeking enhanced clean energy tax credits. Projects over $1 million must
        use 15% apprentice labor hours. This applies in all states regardless of state law.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-serif text-xl text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">Data sources</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Data is compiled from state statutes, administrative codes, and state apprenticeship
        agency websites. Each state page includes source URLs for verification. Data is
        manually curated and periodically verified.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-serif text-xl text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">SAA vs. OA states</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        States are classified as either <strong>SAA</strong> (State Apprenticeship Agency) states,
        which run their own apprenticeship programs, or <strong>OA</strong> (Office of Apprenticeship)
        states, where the federal Department of Labor manages apprenticeship programs. About 30
        states operate their own programs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-serif text-xl text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">Disclaimer</h2>

        This is an unofficial resource. Always verify requirements with your state
        apprenticeship agency and legal counsel before relying on this information for
